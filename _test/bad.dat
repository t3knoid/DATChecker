Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer mixture for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and cool completely.®®Place one duck on its back and, beginning at cavity, cut horizontally completely through the bird along one side at slight downware angle.  Cut just above the thigh and below the breast.  Leave the wing attached to the thigh-leg portion.  Repeat on other side.  Bend thigh-leg portion down, over the edge of a table, snapping backbone to separate wing end from thigh end.  Cut through skin and discard wings and attached backbone or reserve for other use.®®Repeat process with all of the remaining ducks.  You will now have 6 meaty duck sections and 3 wing and backbone parts for soup or other use.®®After the marinade has cooled, place breast and thigh-leg duck parts in a glass or ceramic container. Pour the cooled marinade over the ducks, making sure meaty portions are well coated with mixture. Cover container with plastic wrap and refrigerate for three to five days. Turn the duck parts once a day.  Make sure meaty portions are well covered by the marinade.®®When ready to cook, remove duck parts from container and discard marinade. Truss the legs of each duck together loosely with cotton string. Place leg sections of duck on rack in a roasting pan and roast at 425 degrees, for 1 hour 15 minutes. Duck will be very brown and crisp. Cool completely. Trim and discard any backbone section remaining attached to thigh-leg portions.®®While legs are cooking, remove breast meat from rib sections, retaining as much skin covering on the meat as possible.  Discard excess fat and pierce the skin covering the breasts with a fork or paring knife in several places.  This will allow interior fat to drain off during cooking.®®To cook breasts, place them skin side toward heat under broiler and cook for about 7 minutes or until meat begins to firm to slight pressure.  Turn and cook an additional 4 minutes for rare.  Place breasts on a platter and keep warm.  Place thigh-leg portions skin side toward heat source and grill briefly, until skin crisps up and meat heats through. Remove from broiler and separate legs from thighs.®®To serve, cut a breast portion across the grain into slices and arrange on a plate.  Arrange a thigh and a leg of grilled duck next to several spoonfuls of fresh chutney on same plate and garnish with a sprig of cilantro.þ

Let cool on a rack for 10 minutes.®®In a small bowl, combine the remaining strained tea and the creme de cassis.  Brush over the warm brownies and let cool completely on the rack.®®In a small saucepan, melt the preserves over moderate heat, stirring frequently.  Strain the preserves and spread them over the brownies. ®®In a small heavy saucepan, bring the cream to a boil over moderately high heat.  Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining 2 teaspoons tea leaves; let steep for 5 minutes.  (if teabags are used, they'll need to be pressed in order to obtain the essence of the tea.  It doesn't readily give in to the cream) Strain the cream into a small clean saucepan and return to a boil.  Remove from the heat and add the bittersweet chocolate.  Stir until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth.  Let cool for 5 minutes.®®Using a flat spatula, spread the chocolate ganache over the brownies in an even layer.
